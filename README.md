## repo tasks

- [x] switch css to tailwind
- [x] order tasks by time
- [x] disable checkboxes on all but the first task
  - so if you do something out of order, you gotta update the time for it so it's at the top, and then mark as done ...
- [x] click a task to modify details
- [x] initial reschedule algo:
  - if you complete something early, nothing happens; if you complete something late, all other tasks are bumped later too
  - if a task is modified to overlap with another task, confirm user wants to bump the existing task later, and accordingly bump rest of schedule as needed
- [x] what should happen when the day rolls over? for mvp, can just provide a manual "clear all" button
- [x] local storage for mvp
- [ ] fix responsiveness on iphone
- [x] host mvp on firebase
- [ ] add checkbox to "make a habit" → then we can have a second list that gets injected daily
- [x] on check, cross out task and enable next checkbox
- [x] constrain available hours
- [x] fix deleteTask is not defined on onclick event
- [x] label start time and duration inputs
- [x] max width for app ?
- [x] visually separate the creation ui (task-form)
- [x] move delete task button to the right ?
- [x] on-add/form validation
- [x] "tap again to delete"
- [x] if task is running late, switch to yellow text as warning

- [x] (v2) move away from browser alerts to custom modals
- [ ] (v2) automatically convert scheduled tasks to unscheduled when rescheduling pushes them past midnight
- [x] (v2) confetti burst animation when you check off a task
- [x] (v2) add a lock feature (🔒) that prevents a task from being auto-rescheduled
- [x] (v2) publish preview link under shortlink (https://tinyurl.com/fortudo-v2)
- [x] (v2) add un-schedule button (maybe a down arrow before the edit icon?)
- [x] (v2) clear all scheduled tasks only (drop down on main clear all button?)
- [x] (v2) record some playwright tests (https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen-intro)
- [ ] (v2) clear schedule on a new day (unschedule incomplete tasks)
- [x] (v2) highlight gaps in schedule with dashed separator and duration label

- [ ] (vNext) add horizontal timeline bar to see schedule and gaps more easily
- [x] (vNext) ~~try https://tinybase.org/ for local-first sync, storage, conflict-free replicated data (crdt)~~ local-first sync via PouchDB + CouchDB
- [ ] (vNext) add a version of my `tracks` app to this (either directly or more like a plugin, somehow..?)
- [ ] (vNext) rename `dom-handler.js` to `dom-renderer.js` or `view.js` (it's a rendering/view layer, not a feature handler)
