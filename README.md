## repo tasks

- [x] switch css to tailwind
- [x] order tasks by time
- [x] disable checkboxes on all but the first task
  - so if you do something out of order, you gotta update the time for it so it's at the top, and then mark as done ...
- [x] click a task to modify details
- [x] initial reschedule algo:
  - if you complete something early, nothing happens; if you complete something late, all other tasks are bumped later too
  - if a task is modified to overlap with another task, confirm user wants to bump the existing task later, and accordingly bump rest of schedule as needed
- [x] what should happen when the day rolls over? for mvp, can just provide a manual "clear all" button
- [x] local storage for mvp
- [ ] fix responsiveness on iphone
- [x] host mvp on firebase
- [ ] add checkbox to "make a habit" â†’ then we can have a second list that gets injected daily
- [x] on check, cross out task and enable next checkbox
- [x] constrain available hours
- [x] fix deleteTask is not defined on onclick event
- [x] label start time and duration inputs
- [x] max width for app ?
- [x] visually separate the creation ui (task-form)
